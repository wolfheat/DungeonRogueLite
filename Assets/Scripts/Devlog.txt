Dungeon Generator Project 2025

DEVLOG FOR Dungeon RogueLite Game
MAYBE for Palette Lock Jam

June 2025

* IDEAS
- Make a third person dungeon roguelike game with strict color panel from jam.

 9/6	* Project started
10/6	* Color palette revealed
		* Player movement implemented
		* Camera follows above player
		* Player aims at mouse and turns towards it
		* Mouse tile position can now be shown - use later for targeting
		* Player can collide with DungeonExits
		* Player is limited to not go into walls

		
		// Make player unable to pass into enemies positions
		// FIx combat interactions
		
		// Fix a start dungeon positioning



		// MUST HAVE
		*	Gridbased Movement (instant or animated)?
		*	Enemies movement - attack - deaths
		*	Items dropped
		*	Stats upgradable
		*	Currency dropped - gold and long term
		

		// LIKE TO HAVE
		* Random Generated dungeons



		// PROB NOT




		// Have developers able to set instant stairs?

		// Implement doors?



		* Make the changes for tilemaps code better
		* Make changing rotation of stairs update the map correctly


		// WANTS
		// Make the new tilemap autoselect in hierachy so painting can be done on it directly
